									<h3>Technology Intergration</h3>
									<p>As an educator, I’m skilled at integrating technology into my teaching, which allows me to create more interactive and engaging learning experiences. Whether it’s incorporating multimedia elements like videos or interactive tools into my lessons, I always look for ways to enhance student engagement and make the material more accessible. My background in technology gives me the confidence to experiment with different digital tools and platforms, ensuring that my students not only understand the content but also become comfortable with the tech skills they’ll need in the future.</p>

									<h3>Flexible</h3>
									<p>I’m adaptable and can adjust my teaching strategies based on student feedback and progress, ensuring a dynamic and responsive learning environment. Communication and leadership are central to my approach, skills I’ve gained through my involvement in AFL, where I’ve learned to use my voice and work effectively with a team.</p>

									<h3><a href="images/IMG_1186.jpg" target="_blank">Understanding Diversity</a></h3>
									<p>Cultural awareness is something I deeply value in my approach to teaching. Through my work and interest in Aboriginal communities and Social Justice principles, I’ve developed a strong understanding of the importance of inclusivity and respect for diverse backgrounds. I make it a priority to create a classroom environment where every student feels valued and understood. By incorporating culturally relevant materials and promoting open discussions about different perspectives, I aim to foster a space where students can learn not just from the curriculum, but from each other. My goal is to build a learning community that celebrates diversity and encourages empathy and respect.</p>
